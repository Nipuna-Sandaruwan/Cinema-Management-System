# Cinema Management System

## Overview
This project is a Java-based **Cinema Management System** developed as part of the **Software Development II (4COSC010C.2) coursework**. It simulates a cinema seat reservation system for **The London Lumiere**, allowing users to book and cancel seats, view the seating arrangement, and manage ticket details. The project follows object-oriented programming principles and implements **arrays, classes, methods, and sorting algorithms**.

## Features
### Part A: Seat Management
1. **Menu System:** A console-based menu allowing users to interact with the system.
2. **Buy Ticket:** Allows a user to select a seat and mark it as occupied.
3. **Cancel Ticket:** Cancels a booked seat and marks it as available.
4. **View Seating Arrangement:** Displays available ('O') and booked ('X') seats.
5. **Find First Available Seat:** Finds and displays the first available seat.

### Part B: Ticket and User Information
6. **Person Class:** Stores user details (name, surname, and email).
7. **Ticket Class:** Stores ticket details (row, seat, price, and associated person).
8. **Ticket Storage:** A standard array to store tickets sold during the session.
9. **Print Ticket Info:** Displays all purchased tickets and calculates the total price.
10. **Search Ticket:** Checks if a specific seat is booked and retrieves ticket details.
11. **Sort Tickets:** Sorts all tickets by price using a sorting algorithm.

### Part C: Testing & Evaluation
12. **Self-Evaluation Form:** A detailed assessment of the implementation.
13. **Code Style:** Proper indentation, comments, and meaningful variable names.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Standard Edition)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ
- **Data Structures:** Arrays (standard arrays only, no ArrayList or Maps)
- **Sorting Algorithm:** Implemented for ticket sorting

## How to Run the Project
1. Download and extract the project ZIP file.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ (or any Java-compatible IDE).
3. Run the **CinemaManagement.java** file.
4. Interact with the console menu to test different features.
